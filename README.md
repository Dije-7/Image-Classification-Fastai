# Image-Classification-Fastai

An Image Classifier which uses the fastai, a deep learning library built on top of Pytorch that provides both high-level and low-level components to quickly build state-of-the-art models for common deep learning domains.

This model can classify images of fruits into a binary category: rotten or not. 
You can imagine such a model being used inside refrigerators to detect if produce kept inside it has gone bad or not.
